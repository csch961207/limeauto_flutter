# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  push:
    tags: # 当我们提交代码为tag 是以'v'开头的时候才会触发自动部署到服务端 如 git push tag v0.1.0
      - 'v*'

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
